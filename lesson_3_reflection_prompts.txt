When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

		When collaborating with others. Also to allow you to work remotely from any computer that has an internet connection.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

		Because you may be working on something that is incomplete. Pulling manully ensures that you will not disturb any completed or in-progress work.
